## Features

### Core Features
- **Client-Server Architecture** with multithreading support for multiple simultaneous connections
- **File Operations**: Upload, download, and list files with detailed metadata
- **Custom TCP Socket-based Protocol** for efficient and reliable file transfers
- **File Integrity Checking** using SHA-256 hashing to prevent corruption
- **File Duplicate Management** with automatic versioning (filename_v2.txt, etc.)
- **Comprehensive Logging System** for both server and client activities

### Advanced Features
- **Web Interface** using Flask with a modern, responsive Bootstrap design
- **User Authentication and Access Control** with admin/user roles
- **Resumable Uploads and Downloads** with checkpointing for interrupted transfers
- **Progress Tracking** with real-time progress bars (CLI and web)
- **File Metadata** including size, modification time, and checksums

## System Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Socket Server** (`server/server.py`): 
   - Handles direct TCP connections for file transfers
   - Manages authentication and access control
   - Processes file operations (upload, download, list)
   - Maintains file integrity and versioning

2. **Web Server** (`server/web_server.py`):
   - Provides a user-friendly web interface
   - Handles file uploads through HTTP
   - Manages user authentication and session control
   - Offers admin features (user management, logs)

3. **Command-Line Client** (`client/client.py`):
   - Connects to the socket server for file operations
   - Provides a command-line interface for scripting and automation
   - Supports resumable transfers and progress tracking

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Key dependencies:
   - socket (built-in)
   - threading (built-in)
   - hashlib (built-in)
   - logging (built-in)
   - tqdm==4.66.1 (for progress bars)
   - flask==2.3.3 (for web interface)
   - werkzeug==2.3.7 (for secure file handling)
   - flask-login==0.6.2 (for user authentication)

## Usage

### Starting the Servers

1. **Start the Socket Server**:
   ```
   python server/server.py
   ```
   The server will start on port 9000 by default.

2. **Start the Web Server** (optional, for web interface):
   ```
   python server/web_server.py
   ```
   The web server will start on port 5000 by default.

### Command-Line Interface

The command-line client provides the following commands:

1. **Authentication**:
   ```
   python client/client.py login <username> <password>
   ```
   Default credentials: admin / admin123

2. **List Files**:
   ```
   python client/client.py list
   ```

3. **Upload File**:
   ```
   python client/client.py upload <file_path>
   ```
   With overwrite option:
   ```
   python client/client.py upload <file_path> --overwrite
   ```

4. **Download File**:
   ```
   python client/client.py download <filename>
   ```

5. **Resume Upload** (for interrupted uploads):
   ```
   python client/client.py resume <file_path>
   ```

6. **Resume Download** (for interrupted downloads):
   ```
   python client/client.py download <filename> --resume
   ```

7. **Specify Server** (optional):
   ```
   python client/client.py --host <hostname> --port <port> <command>
   ```

### Web Interface

Access the web interface by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

1. **Login**: Use the login form with default credentials (admin/admin123)

2. **File Management**:
   - View all files with size and modification time
   - Download files with a single click
   - Upload files with progress tracking
   - Delete files (admin only)

3. **User Management** (admin only):
   - View all users and their roles
   - Add new users with specified roles
   - Delete existing users

4. **System Logs** (admin only):
   - View server, web server, and database logs
   - Filter logs by type
   - Auto-refresh logs

## Custom Protocol

The system uses a custom TCP-based protocol for client-server communication:

### Message Format
- **Header**: 8-byte length prefix (using `struct.pack`)
- **Body**: JSON-encoded message with command and data

### Commands
- `AUTH`: Authenticate with username and password
- `UPLOAD`: Upload a file with metadata
- `DOWNLOAD`: Request a file download
- `LIST`: Request a list of available files
- `RESUME`: Resume an interrupted upload

### Status Codes
- `OK`: Operation successful
- `ERROR`: Operation failed
- `AUTH_REQUIRED`: Authentication required
- `AUTH_SUCCESS`: Authentication successful
- `AUTH_FAILED`: Authentication failed
- `FILE_NOT_FOUND`: Requested file not found
- `CHECKSUM_FAILED`: File integrity check failed

### Example Protocol Flow (Upload)
1. Client sends: `{"command": "UPLOAD", "data": {"filename": "example.txt", "file_size": 1024, "file_hash": "abc123..."}}`
2. Server responds: `{"status": "OK", "data": {"ready": true, "temp_id": "example.txt"}}`
3. Client sends file data in chunks
4. Server responds: `{"status": "OK", "data": {"message": "Upload successful", "filename": "example.txt", "size": 1024, "hash": "abc123..."}}`

## Security Features

1. **Authentication**:
   - Username/password verification
   - Password hashing using SHA-256
   - Session-based authentication in web interface

2. **Access Control**:
   - Role-based permissions (admin vs. regular users)
   - Admin-only operations (delete files, manage users, view logs)

3. **File Security**:
   - Integrity verification using SHA-256 hashing
   - Secure filename handling to prevent path traversal
   - Temporary file storage during transfers

4. **Web Security**:
   - CSRF protection in web forms
   - Secure cookie handling
   - Input validation and sanitization

## Reliability Features

1. **File Integrity**:
   - SHA-256 hash verification before and after transfer
   - Automatic rejection of corrupted files

2. **Resumable Transfers**:
   - Server tracks partial uploads with byte position
   - Clients can resume from last successful byte
   - Temporary files for in-progress transfers

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive error detection and reporting
   - Graceful handling of network interruptions
   - Detailed logging for troubleshooting

4. **Concurrency**:
   - Multithreaded server handles multiple clients
   - Thread-safe operations with proper locking
   - Connection pooling and resource management

## Configuration

### Server Configuration

Key configuration variables in `server/server.py`:
```python
HOST = '0.0.0.0'            
PORT = 9000                 
SHARED_FILES_DIR = '...'    
REQUIRE_AUTH = True         
```

Key configuration variables in `server/web_server.py`:
```python
HOST = '0.0.0.0'            
PORT = 5000                 
MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH = 1GB    
```

### Client Configuration

Key configuration variables in `client/client.py`:
```python
DEFAULT_HOST = 'localhost'  
DEFAULT_PORT = 9000        
DOWNLOAD_DIR = '...'       
```

### Protocol Configuration

Key configuration variables in `protocol.py`:
```python
HEADER_SIZE = 8             
CHUNK_SIZE = 8192           
ENCODING = 'utf-8'          
```

### Logging

Logs are stored in the `logs/` directory:
- `server.log`: Socket server logs
- `web_server.log`: Web server logs
- `database.log`: User database logs
- `client.log`: Client-side logs

Enable debug logging by modifying the log level in `utils.py`:
```python
setup_logger('server', 'logs/server.log', level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## TBD for final submission

Resume Interrupted Downloads (Checkpointing)
• If a download is interrupted due to network failure, allow resumption from the last
received byte instead of restarting.
• Implement file chunking where files are sent in parts instead of all at once.
• Store metadata (file size, last received chunk) to track incomplete downloads

## Default Credentials

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`
